            Fluorescence signals are often reported in **arbitrary units** or as a **dF/F ratio**, which can hide signal degradation over time. This practice can result in large differences in signal strength between labs using similar protocols, often without realizing it. Such variation undermines the **reproducibility** of quantitative measurements across imaging systems and research groups.

            **Low signal magnitudes** lead to noisier, less precise measurements and limit the quality of scientific conclusions. Without a standardized way to evaluate signal magnitude, labs may miss key opportunities to improve data quality by optimizing imaging parameters and hardware.

            We strongly recommend reporting fluorescence signals in **absolute physical units** such as **detected photon counts per second**. This standardization provides a consistent framework for comparing signal levels across systems, supporting **long-term system monitoring**, **inter-lab comparisons**, and **quantitative benchmarks** for multiphoton microscopy.

            Direct photon counting requires specialized electronics, but you can use the fundamental **signal-noise statistics** of photon detection to estimate detector photon sensitivity. This lets you convert detected signals from arbitrary units to estimated **absolute photon counts**, providing a solid foundation for rigorous scientific comparison.

                The **Photon Transfer Curve (PTC)** is a powerful tool for characterizing imaging detectors. It uses the fundamental relationship between signal and noise in photon-limited systems to provide quantitative insight into detector performance and enables absolute calibration of fluorescence measurements.

                **Photon shot noise** follows **Poisson statistics**: the variance of photon arrivals equals the mean number of photons detected. For an ideal detector in the photon-limited regime, the **variance of the detected signal is directly proportional to the mean signal intensity**.

                The **photon sensitivity** parameter K is the conversion factor between digital units and actual photons detected. For a detector with photon sensitivity K (in digital units per photon):

                **Variance = K Ã— Mean + Offset**

                Here, **Variance** is the pixel-to-pixel or frame-to-frame variance, **Mean** is the average signal intensity, **K** is the photon sensitivity, and **Offset** accounts for electronic noise. By measuring mean and variance pairs at different intensities and plotting them, you can determine K from the **slope of the linear fit**.

                Once you know K from PTC analysis, you can convert any measured signal from arbitrary units to **absolute photon counts**: **Photons = Signal / K**. This conversion is the basis for rigorous scientific analysis and cross-system comparisons.

            ### Protocol for Absolute Fluorescence Signal Estimation

            1. **Prepare a fluorescent sample** that provides uniform fluorescence across the field of view. A fluorescent slide or coverslip with beads is ideal. Biological samples with stable regions can work, but uniform samples are best for calibration.

            2. **Set up the microscope.** Fix the detector gain for all measurements. Make sure the detector operates in its **linear range**. Turn off any automatic gain, temporal averaging, or signal processing that could affect noise.

            3. **Acquire calibration data.** Capture about **500 consecutive frames** of the same field. Select several **regions of interest** at different intensities to cover your detectorâ€™s dynamic range. For each region, measure the **mean intensity** and **variance** across frames.

            4. **Calculate photon sensitivity.** Use the frame-to-frame difference method to isolate quantum noise. For consecutive frames X and X', compute the mean as Â½(X + X') and variance as Â½(X' - X)Â². This removes correlated noise and preserves photon shot noise for accurate PTC analysis.

            5. **Plot the Photon Transfer Curve.** Graph variance versus mean intensity for all regions. **Fit a linear regression** to the data. The **slope** is the photon sensitivity K (digital units per photon); the **y-intercept** is the electronic noise floor.

            6. **Convert signals to photon counts.** For any measured signal S, calculate photon count N as N = S / K. This gives absolute photon counts, independent of detector settings, for quantitative comparison across sessions and systems.
