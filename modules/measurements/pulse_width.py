            Nearly all multiphoton microscopy uses modelocked ultrafast lasers with pulse durations on the order of 100 femtoseconds (100 √ó 10‚Åª¬π‚Åµ s). Due to the nonlinearity of multiphoton excitation, peak intensity matters more than average power for efficient excitation.

            The efficiency of multiphoton excitation using pulsed lasers versus continuous wave (CW) lasers, with the same time-averaged power, is given by:

            g‚ÅΩ‚Åø‚Åæ = g‚ÅΩ‚Åø‚Åæ‚Çö / (œÑf·µ£)‚Åø‚Åª¬π

            Where:
            - g‚ÅΩ‚Åø‚Åæ is the enhancement factor
            - œÑ is the pulse width
            - f·µ£ is the repetition rate
            - n is number of photons in the absorption process

            For two-photon imaging with a standard Ti-sapphire laser (80 MHz, 150 fs pulses), this enhancement over CW lasers is ~50,000 and is strongly dependent on pulse width.

            As pulses travel through optical components, they experience dispersion which can temporally broaden or "stretch" the pulse, reducing excitation efficiency. This broadening can be counteracted with dispersion compensation.

                ### Understanding Group Delay Dispersion (GDD)

                Group Delay Dispersion (GDD) is a measure of how different wavelength components of a pulse are delayed relative to each other as they travel through optical materials.

                - **Positive GDD**: Blue components travel slower than red components, stretching the pulse
                - **Negative GDD**: Red components travel slower than blue components

                Most optical materials (glass, water) introduce positive GDD. To compensate, we introduce negative GDD using specialized optics.

                The optimal GDD setting is where the negative GDD from the compensation unit exactly balances the positive GDD from the microscope's optical path, resulting in the shortest possible pulse at the sample.

                For a given material, the more material the pulse propagates through, the greater the temporal broadening. Microscopes with elaborate optical systems have more glass elements, resulting in more dispersion that needs to be compensated.

               - Place the sample under the objective and focus

               - Adjust the GDD value in steps (typically ¬±500 fs¬≤)
               - For each GDD value, record the mean and maximum pixel values
               - Find the GDD value that maximizes the signal intensity

            4. **Verify optimization**
               - Plot pixel intensity vs. GDD value
               - The optimal GDD value should be at the peak of the curve
               - Save this value for future reference at this wavelength
