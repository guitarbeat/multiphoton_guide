            **Abstract:**
            
            The goal of this protocol is to improve the characterization and performance standardization of multiphoton microscopy hardware across a large user base. We purposefully focus on hardware and only briefly touch on software and data analysis routines where relevant. Here we cover the measurement and quantification of laser power, pulse width optimization, field of view, resolution and photomultiplier tube performance. The intended audience is scientists with little expertise in optics who either build or use multiphoton microscopes in their laboratories. They can use our procedures to test whether their multiphoton microscope performs well and produces consistent data over the lifetime of their system. Individual procedures are designed to take 1–2 h to complete without the use of expensive equipment. The procedures listed here help standardize the microscopes and facilitate the reproducibility of data across setups.
